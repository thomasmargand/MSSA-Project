## Title: Cloud Application and Development Project Proposal
### Author: Thomas Margand
### Date: 26 February 2018

The purpose of this document is to outline and evaluate potential project ideas for the course project to be completed
during the Microsoft Software Systems Academy Cohort Four. This paper will discuss three different ideas for
consideration. The discussion of each idea will include an explanation of the various components for each program and
how it would work. The discussion will also include some pros and cons along with possible obstacles for completing
each.

**Electronic Learning System**

This program would feature a curriculum for teaching users how to skydive in accordance with the Skydiver's Information
Manual published by the Unites States Parachute Association. The program would feature a graphic user interface that
would allow users to create an individual account that would save and track progress through the course. The course would outline the student program for progression toward the first level of skydiving certification known as the A license. The course is broken down into eight categories A-H.  Each category would feature a content section of text to be read and referenced by the user in order to complete the quizzes within each category. The content section would outline the terminal learning objectives for that category.  The quizzes will be multiple choice, allow the user one attempt and the category content cannot be accessed within the program at the same time as the quiz, therefore the quizzes are not open book. The user cannot access the course content of the next category until they have taken the quiz for the preceding category. The culminating course event will be a cumulative test. The program will track and average quiz scores to give the student a grade. Finally the program would feature a master account allowing the course instructor to access and track the progress of all the course participants.

The pros of this project idea are that the content for this curriculum already exists, and I am very familiar with that
content, therefore it would require very little effort to implement. This would afford me more time to focus on coding the program. The cons of this project idea are that the program only addresses the academic textbook portions of skydiving instruction, a physical activity. Therefore the utility of the program as a learning instrument is limited. The obstacles to this project are found in creating a program that allows users to create and store individual accounts. Another obstacle is finding a way to allow a course instructor to create a master account. Yet another obstacle is determining if the program will only exist on one local machine or if I will have the programming ability to create this program on a cloud structure allowing users to interface with it from any web enabled device.

**Database GUI**

This program would feature a database of information on every make and model of parachute currently available for consumer purchase today. Each entry would feature the original date of introduction, sizes available, manufacturer suggested retail price, intended skill level of user, intended discipline of use, number of cells, construction materials, available colors, and a description of the canopy itself. The program would have a graphic user interface that allowed the user to query the database through a number of different filters such as canopy size, price, etc.

The pros of this program are that the content for each database entry already exist and are relatively simple to obtain. The cons are that this program might be overly simplistic and not showcase the full array of skills obtained from this course of instruction. The obstacles to this program are creating a database sophisticated enough to allow the user to complete filtered searches. The returns from those searches should not be in table format, but rather entries that can be selected by the user then displaying an entire article for each entry similar to an online store.

**Strategy Game**

This program would feature a trivia game based on multiple choice questions from different categories. Categories could include anything from pop culture to history or geography. The program would feature a graphic user interface and each play of the game would allot the user 3 lives. Each question answered incorrectly would cost the user a life. Users would have 20 seconds to read and answer each question and can change categories between questions. The program would store high scores similar to an arcade style game. The program would feature a database of questions that exists within each category and a method for random selection of questions within each category. The program would have a method for compiling users' scores and displaying them on the interface while the user was playing. Each question within the program would be equally weighted. The twenty second timer for each question would also be displayed on the interface for the user to see.   

The pros to this program are that it would be fun to interact with throughout the design and creation process. Also the project lends itself to a natural evolution if the initial concept ends up being too simple. The game could feature a hint function or lifelines, bonus questions more heavily weighted, or bonuses for completing every question within a category. The cons to this project would be compiling different questions and answers across different categories that are relatively equivalent in difficulty. This could prove time consuming and detract from time spent actually coding the program. Obstacles to this program would be trying to incorporate a method that calls questions from within each category randomly. Programs follow instructions and the idea of random is that it does not have an instruction or pattern. This could be very difficult.

In conclusion these project ideas present a variety of utility along with a variety of challenges and obstacles to completion. Each idea will have to be carefully considered in conjunction with the skill sets required to complete them before moving forward.
