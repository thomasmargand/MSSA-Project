## Title: Cloud Application and Development Project Selection

After considerable deliberation and consideration I have chosen to move forward with the electronic learning system as my project. I believe this project is sufficiently robust enough to remain both interesting and challenging. I also believe this project will be able to appropriately leverage the learning path of this course and utilize most of the techniques and skills that we will learn. To discuss this proposal in more depth I will be breaking the project down into some common sense categories and components discussing the intended outcome as well as how I intend to get there.

**GUI**

The intended graphical user interface for this program is very simple. This program will mimic other learning and test prep programs you are likely to have used before. The interface will prompt the user to either login or create an account with textboxes and a login button. Once the user has logged in they will land on the course content for the introductory section. The program will feature 9 content sections explained in more detail below. The user will be able to navigate the program in two ways one linear the other using an index. The linear progression will feature two buttons at the bottom of the content page, one button labeled "take quiz", the other button labeled "next section".  This will be true for every section except the introductory section which will only feature a "next section" button. A user will only be able to navigate to the next section if they have completed the quiz for the current section. The last section will have three buttons, and the third will be labeled "take exam". This button can only be interacted with if the user has passed the quiz from the last section.

The index method of navigating the program will be accessible through a menu bar made visible by tapping the top of the screen or moving the mouse to the top of the screen, similar to the kind we have built in class labs.  When the menu bar is made visible it will feature a button labeled "menu". Selecting this button will pull up an ordered menu that allows the user navigate directly to any section of the program that they have unlocked or corresponding quiz, which can be re-taken. The buttons for all the course content will be visible to the user even if they have not yet unlocked that section, but they will be prohibited from interacting with that button if they have not unlocked that section. In addition to the content buttons there will be a "grades" button and "settings" button. The grades button will lead to a page featuring the users current average percentage score based on the quizzes they have taken thus far.  This page will average the most current scores when it is called.  If a user has re-taken a quiz the average will only reflect their most recent score, historical quiz scores will not be stored.  The settings page will allow the user to change their login information.

The quizzes in the program will vary in length from 10-20 questions, all will be multiple choice with 4 possible answer choices. There will be no time limit on the quizzes. The users can only move through the quiz in linear order and can not skip questions and return to them later, they will be unable to proceed to the next question until they select an answer choice. Students will be given their score at the end of the exam but will not be shown which questions they answered incorrectly or correctly. A score of 70% or higher will be required to advance to the next section of the program. If the user passes they will be prompted with 2 buttons to either "re-take the quiz" or advance to the "next section". If the user does not pass they will be prompted to either re-take the quiz or navigate back to the preceding section to re-study the material. The final exam will feature 25 questions and will still require a 70% to pass.

**Content**      

As previously mentioned the course of instruction for this program follows 8 categories labeled A-H, there will also be an introductory section.  When a user is logging in for the first time the layout will default to the introductory content. The content will be in PDF format each section featuring text and images. The entire PDF for each section will be laid out on one screen allowing the user to scroll up and down to view any content within that section. The content for the course can be found here; https://uspa.org/Portals/0/files/Man_SIM_2018.pdf.

The quizzes will only have one set of questions per section. For example if the Category A quiz has 15 questions it will always have the same 15 questions every time it is re-taken, however the order of the questions may vary. The final exam will be 25 questions pooled randomly from the library of quiz questions in the preceding sections. This exam will be different every time it is taken and like the quizzes will not tell the user which questions they answered correctly or incorrectly.  Successful completion of the program will land the user on a Congratulatory page.

**Database**

The content pages for this program will not need to be stored in a database as they will just be objects to be referenced by the program. The user will not be able to interact with or manipulate the content it will be read only. However the quiz questions will need to be in a database in order for the final exam to be able to reference them at random. It will be a challenge to determine how to store both the questions and answers together on a database so that a questions is always called with the correct corresponding answer choices for that question.  My initial plan is to place each individual quiz in it's own table.

This represents the initial planning phase for this project and it's implementation.
